# Maze
A simple maze game using OpenGl, SDL

This is a simple interactive 3D game written entirely on OpenGL and using SDL for user-interfacing (keyboard,etc)
The game uses tank controls (WASD) and some simple direct and ambient lighting. The goal is to reach the exit
flag by collecting colored keys to unlock their respective doors.
